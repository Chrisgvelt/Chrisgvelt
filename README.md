ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christopher Groeneveldt - Senior Software Engineer.

An organized, collaborative and highly skilled full stack developer with 13+ years of professional experience in dynamic and deadline-driven work environments.
Self-motivated and self-taught professional who likes to solve difficult problem, creative & open-mind.

I am a cross-chain protocol expert and senior full-stack blockchain engineer who is very familiar with Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, Bitcoin networks with blockchain next generation features like Layer-2, Zero Knowledge and Cross-chain transaction solutions with 8 years of experience.

I have developed DEX (ERC20), Staking DApp, Swap DApp, Lending DApp, Insurance DApp, Portfolio management DApp and NFT marketplace DApps (ERC721, ERC1155 based) from scratch as a senior full stack developer and lead developer based on Solidity / Ethereum for 7 years.
And also took part in auditing and validating various smart contracts, SDKs and protocols based on ethereum layer-1 while I was working in OpenZeppelin company for 3 years and just became very familiar with ethereum ecosystem.

I have developed Solana based DApps (DAO and NFT marketplace) using Rust for smart contract and PolkadotJS, Substrate SDK, Solana Web3 integration in SynesisOne company for 5 years.

Recent 2 years, I mostly focused on Rust-Substrate based blockchain networks just like Polkadot and ZK-sync solution (Zk-proof & Zk-snark) implementation in Parami Foundation company using Veramo SDK.

For developing successful DApps, I used IPFS for data safe protection and optimized the contract using off-chain service (Oracle) and distributed data management with on-chain and off-chain datastore for gas fee reduction and speed optimization.
I also solved several security problem using Openzepplin logic and other solutions (Proxy logic and Storage logic, etc) and implemented AI based financial solutions to avoid risk from high-changing price of cryptocurrency pairs.â€‹

I have also rich experience with Python while working for AI, Image processing, Automation engine development and Node.js, Django/Flask for backend development for 9+ years and also rich experience with React.js for frontend especially using Hooks and Typescript for 12+ years.
I am very familiar with Clouding services (AWS, GCP, Azure) and GraphQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, Unit test tools (Jest and Mocha) and DevOps tools including Github, Trello, Jira and container tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible).
